**Tic-tac-toe** (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs and Os/‚ÄúX‚Äôy O‚Äôsies‚Äù (Ireland), is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3√ó3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
